				<strong class="title2">Strengthened Abilities</strong><br>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Implementability, problem-solving ability</strong> : It has been strengthened through the process of implementing the algorithm as code.</li>
<li><strong>Patience, concentration</strong> : It has been strengthened through the process of trying after thinking about how to solve the error.</li>
<li><strong>Inquiry</strong>: It was strengthened through the process of designing an algorithm after thinking about how to solve a problem.</li>
					</ul>
